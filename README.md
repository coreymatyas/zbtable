# zbtable BBCode Editor

This is a small, clientside webapp to assist in the creation and editing of BBCode tables, 
specifically in the format used by ZetaBoards. Currently, this webapp can create tables by 
adding rows and columns and inputting data, load pre-existing tables to be edited, and 
dynamically output the current table in realtime. It has support for table titles and 
headers. 

At the moment, this only works for ZetaBoards-style tables, however official BBCode tables 
will be supported "eventually" (whenever I don't have something else to do). Feel free to 
submit a pull request if you get to it first!
